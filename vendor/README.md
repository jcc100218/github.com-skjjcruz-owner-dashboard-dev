# Vendored third-party runtime libraries

These files are **self-hosted on purpose**. The app's HTML entry point
(`index.html`) loads React and ReactDOM from here via same-origin `<script src="vendor/…">` tags
instead of a public CDN.

## Why

React/ReactDOM were previously loaded from `unpkg.com` with no fallback. When
unpkg had a transient hiccup, React never defined, every component threw
"React is not defined", and the app rendered a blank screen. Serving these
same-origin removes that single point of failure: if the page itself loads,
React loads with it.

## Files

| File | Package | Version |
|------|---------|---------|
| `react.production.min.js`     | `react`     | 18.3.1 |
| `react-dom.production.min.js` | `react-dom` | 18.3.1 |
| `supabase.min.js` | `@supabase/supabase-js` | 2.101.1 |
| `@babel/standalone-7.29.7/babel.min.js` | `@babel/standalone` (from npm, package-lock) | 7.29.7 — only for un-built pages (local dev / raw source); the deploy build strips it |
| `sentry-8.55.0/bundle.min.js` | Sentry browser SDK (the CDN bundle the site loaded since May 2025, unchanged since its Feb 2025 release) | 8.55.0 |
| `html2canvas-1.4.1/html2canvas.min.js` | `html2canvas` (byte-identical to the npm release) | 1.4.1 |

Owner ask 2026-10-12 (AI-key security): no page loads code live from an
outside site. Every page's `script-src` allows only this site, and
`js/shared/no-outside-code.test.js` fails if an outside script comes back.

These are the official UMD production builds (unmodified).

## How to update

Re-download the UMD builds for the new version and replace the files in place
(keep the same filenames — the deploy build cache-busts them automatically via a
content-hash `?v=` query, so no manual version bump in the HTML is needed):

```sh
curl -sS -o vendor/react.production.min.js \
  https://unpkg.com/react@<version>/umd/react.production.min.js
curl -sS -o vendor/react-dom.production.min.js \
  https://unpkg.com/react-dom@<version>/umd/react-dom.production.min.js
```

Then run `npm test` (the regression suite builds the production preview and
boots it headless) before deploying.
